# JavaScript course

My complete notes and coding challenges for the course [The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann.

I started this course as an absolute beginner in JS but this in-depth course took me through the entirety of what JS can offer and showed me all the ins and outs of the programming language. I now feel very comfortable coding in JS and creating my own web app and websites. It took me about 5 months to complete. It started from the basics of the language and then dived deeper into the language. Along the way I created 5 projects that thought me a lot about real-world programming.

This repository covers over a wide range of topics, including:

* Data types and variables
* Functions and scope
* how javascript works behind the scenes.
* Object oriented programming
* modules and Inheritance and new ES6+ features.
* how to bundle our code for production using parcel
* API Get and POST requests
* Data structures in Javascript
* npm packages and how to use them.
* Control flow and loops
* Arrays and objects
* Advanced DOM manipulation
* Asynchronous programming with callbacks, promises, and async/await
* how to write a clean code
* planning for a project.
* problem solving skills.

The notes are organized by topic and provide a comprehensive reference for JavaScript programming.
