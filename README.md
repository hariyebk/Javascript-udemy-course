# JavaScript course

My complete notes and code for the course [The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann.

I started this course as an absolute beginner in JS but this in-depth course took me through the entirety of what JS can offer and showed me all the ins and outs of the programming language. I now feel very comfortable coding in JS and creating my own web app and websites.

It took me about 1 year to complete. It started from the basics of the language and then dived deeper into the language. Along the way I created 5 projects that thought me a lot about real-world programming.
