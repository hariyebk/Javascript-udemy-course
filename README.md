# JavaScript course

My complete notes and code for the course [The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann.

I started this course as an absolute beginner in JS but this in-depth course took me through the entirety of what JS can offer and showed me all the ins and outs of the programming language. I now feel very comfortable coding in JS and creating my own web app and websites.

It took me about 10 weeks to complete. It started from the basics of the language and then dived deeper into the language. Along the way I created 5 projects that thought me a lot about real-world programming.
